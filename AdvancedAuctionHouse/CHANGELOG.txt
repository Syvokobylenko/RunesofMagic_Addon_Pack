NOTE: Due to the updated Filter code, some people will need to use the english filter commands until their language's locale file gets updated to the new system
*rework: Added my own function for setting text to lower that will support non english alphabet letters. (currently supported letters: Ä,Ö,Ü - please submit a bug ticket if your language has other letters that have an upper and lower case versions)
*rework: The entire filter system has been reworked to be modular and allow for other addons to create and register their own filters. This has made the filter code much cleaner, more efficient, and better support for other languages
*rework: All filters that had an optional number will now need to be written like $dura/110
*rework: Bargain and Vendor filters will now only use one filter box using a / to seperate the options. ie $vendor/10/1440 or {{{$bargain//1440}}}
*add: Added a $plus filter that works like dura and tier that filters for items that have a minimum plusing
*add: Added a 4th tab for settings
*add: Added an option to display Materials as Price/Unit/White Mat. This feature allows you to compare the prices of the same mat at different refinement levels much easier.
*add: Added a filter speed option to increase the speed of the filter at the cost of momentary FPS loss
*add: Pet Eggs will now have the level of the pet displayed in the level column and will be a green color to let you know that you can't search for that level as that data is client side and not server side.
*add: Did the same thing with Recipes though I need help from the community to make a list of all the recipes for this feature, currently only 3 recipes will use this feature.
*add: The History items that are not current and therefore do not have working tooltips, Will have a red border

==v2.7.4 - 16 Dec 2010==
*fix: Fixed a bug that prevented tooltips from working correctly in the history window, if there are less then 10 items of history. Bug was introduced in v2.7.0 and was reported by Tiiim.

==v2.7.3 - 16 Dec 2010==
*fix: redesigned my bag click hooks to hopefully be error free now. zBag, yBag, FlieBag, Default and ItemShop bags should all be working now

==v2.7.2 - 15 Dec 2010==
*rework: switched the slash command of /aa to /aah, this was meant to be part of v2.7.0 but got overlooked.
*fix: goof with v2.7.1 caused an error, fixed now

==v2.7.1 - 15 Dec 2010==
*fix: Shift left click on a bag item will now correctly fill in the search name box on the browse tab. Bug was introduced in v2.7.0 and was reported by many, but most notably by Bearndt02.

*rework: The entire code has been cut up and renamed to make my life a ton easier. ALL addons that interfaced with AAH will be broken.(not aware of any though)
*add: Saved Search Feature - works like the category section. Top level is a folder for grouping of searches. Second level is the name of the search. Third level are the options you have for that search. The plus icon will save a search if the panel is open. The new search will go into the currently selected folder, if one is not seleced then you will be prompted to create a folder. All items can be rearranged by simple drag and drop
*rework: History frame will now save entries and allow you to scroll through saved history (current max history is 100 entries). Newest entries will be at the top now and only the top 10 will have working tooltips(this can't be helped).
*add: Slash Command - /aa numhistory <num> - to change the max saved history to an amount other then 100.
*rework: History is now saved via item ID number instead of just name. Many items share names with other items which caused bad history data. Current hack to ensure access to item id may not be fool proof.
*remove: Because of previous, the following tooltips will no longer have working price history tooltips due to lack of access of the item ID number. Craft Ingredients, Auction Bid List Items, Auction Sell List Items
*add: Added tooltip pricehistory support for the following. Loot Items, Vendor Items
*add: History frame will now show min, max, median and avg in the summary instead of just avg

*remove: Removed all old code that dealt with selling/buying items/gold for diamonds
*rework: The website button now is the Forum button and it links to the Advanced AuctionHouse Forums hosted by Curseforge. This button will now ask for promission before opening up your browser.
*rename: The reset button is now the clear button. The function remains the same except it will now affect the category choice aswell.
*rework: The % undercut feature has been changed to % of average. this means where 0% used to be average, now 100% is. This allows users to undercut or overprice.
*rework: Changed the Rarity dropdown items to use the names of the rarity levels and be listed in the color of that rarity.
*rework: Changed the Runes dropdown to be simplier and more accurate. (0+, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+)
*rework: Default duration of new auctions has been changed from 1 day to 3 days
*fix: Reworked the $bargain and $vendor filter code. Fixed a bug in the $bargain code that was introduced in v2.6.0

==v2.6.0 - 25 Nov 2010==
*add: there is now a button that serves as a link to the Advanced Auctionhouse section of the Curse.com website
*add: $tier - works just like $dura but for an item's tier [requested by blwillia]
*rework: $clean, $single, $double, $triple are now $zero, $one, $two, $three, $four, $five, $six. These now search for any color stat and not just green ones. The old commands will still work but this made it simpler for people to spell. [thanks to jrmstuff for suggesting/requesting and code submitting 4-6 stat searching]
*add: you can now combine a stat quantity command with a stat color command in the same filter box(ie $three$yellow - will match items with only 3 stats that are all yellow) NOTE: that you can't use a ! to inverse just one of the commands, a ! inverse the whole filterbox(ie !$three$yellow - will match items that don't have 3 stats and don't have any yellow stats)  [thanks to jrmstuff for suggesting/requesting and code submitting this feature]
*rework/fix: $egglvl and $eggapt to more accurately detect pet eggs for all languages. This may fail as I can only test english. [thanks to artfulpirate for submitting the bug ticket]
*rework: The 3 filter box tooltips have been redesigned to hold more text. Needs to be retranslated for all languages
*remove: The search option for currency type that had no value anymore has been removed to make space.
*rework: The filter info text has been simplified and moved to make space.
*add: The much requested Min/Max price filtering has been added. You can now filter items based on the (Min and Max) (BidPPU or BuyoutPPU or BidPrice or BuyPrice). These will filter items together with the other 3 filter boxes

NOTE: Much of the english locale files have been tweaked, updated, changed, added, and deleted that some things might not look right in the other languages until some translators go through the Localization page and do some updating.

TODO: For next version I will be tackling the highly requested feature of saved searches. Coding time is limited so no promises on a timetable.

==v2.5.0 - 17 Sep 2010==
*add: $egglvl and $eggapt filters for finding eggs with a minimum level or aptitude. This works just like $dura by adding the min number you want. (example: $egglvl20 with filter for all eggs with at least level 20) the default for both if no number is entered is 1 to prevent errors. These features rely on some global client variables which I have not verified that they match to the eggs tooltip wording for all languages. If it doesn't work for your language then please supply a screenshot of an egg tooltip so I can explore better variables to use as well as your language code. (Variables: 'Pet Egg' to detect and filter only eggs. 'Level' to find the level. 'Aptitude' to find the aptitude)
*fix: tweaked $dura to be a tad more efficient to speed up filtering
*update: all local files update to current translations. As always thanks to the translators for their work.

==v2.4.0 - 8 Jun 2010==
*fix: bug caused in v2.3 with the $dura command. thanks to Obi_Wan for sending in the ticket
*fix: bug caused by items with the same icon as gold or diamonds (daily item: Old Gold Coin). added checks for numbers in the name should help fix those false positives on currency transaction checks

==v2.3.0 - 6 Jun 2010==
*rework: bit of fixing, reworking, and streamlining to the filtering code. should make for more accurate use of the $clean, $green, $single, $double, $triple keywords. also should filter a tad faster. Runes should no longer be counted as stats anymore in any of the above. also tiered items should no longer be recognized as green stats due to the tier number being green. orange stats will no longer pass the $clean filter
*note: the new yellow stats that do not currently have stat names will not be recognized as $yellow and can show up under $clean. this is frogster issue to fix along with many server side auctionhouse database bugs that they are not fixing.
*locale: minor updates from the translators, thanks to all that put in work on the localization page, still trying to get curseforge to support Polish

==v2.2.0 - 25 Apr 2010==
*fix: German locale file should work correctly again. minor updates to most of the locales thanks to the translators
*add: Japanese locale file thanks to TBDjp
*fix: searching for items with an  '  will work correctly now
*fix: found a few more hard coded values that got replaced with system variables for better locale support
*add: Current exchange rate values will be transmitted to others through Luna. Created a frame that displays the current exchange rate of gold and diamonds in a small window. Use "/aa exchange" to show/hide this window. This window has little to no value if you do not have Luna installed so it will not be displayed unless it detects Luna. Shift Right click to position the window where you want it. This feature was added to the code before they disabled diamond trading, lets hope it will come back soon

==v2.1.0 - 10 Apr 2010==
*change: moved all filter commands to the locale files
*change: added the words filter and reset to the locale files
*change: replaced many hardcoded system strings with the correct system variable for great locale support
*add: enabled the $bargain command that was mostly finished by Graves. $bargain allows you to search for items that can be sold to a vendor for profit. Use Filter1 = $bargain, Filter2 = minimum profit from bid items (optional), Filter3 = maximum time in minutes for bid items (optional)
*change: all files are now encoded in UTF8 without BOM for better locale support
*change: increased the size of all money input boxes to have better support for large numbers. Shifted a few things to make room for the increased size
*change: shifted the Price/Unit column to allow for larger numbers. reduced the phrase " Buyout Price:" in the Price column to just "Buyout" to allow for the needed space
*change: gold and diamond long term history is no longer saved, just the past 10 auctions to allow for a more fluid exchange rate section
*change: reworked the exchange rate to display diamond to gold and gold to diamond values. these values are from the buyers point of view
*change: reworked the whole bottom panel to have fluid placement based on size of the values. changed the size and position slightly of many buttons
*fix: the location of the close button has been centered to the correct location
*add: Luna has been added as an optional dependency to support an in game new version notification\\
NOTE: much of the locale has to be reverified. because of this, I am marking this as a Beta. English users can consider this a full release

*change: removed the price per unit checkbox. instead there are now 4 input boxes. two for bid and 2 for buyout where one of those represents the total amount and the other the price per unit. whenever you change one of the fields the other will be updated accordingly, for example when you are creating an auction for 10 harpy claws and you change the bid price per unit from 900 to 1000 the total price will be updated from 9000 to 10000.
