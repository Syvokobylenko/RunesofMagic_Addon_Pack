<p>Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and<br />does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of<br />Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or<br />other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related<br />information available on an "as-is" basis.

<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and<br />conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share<br />original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright<br />and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The<br />following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not<br />exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<p>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are<br />intended for use by those authorized to give the public<br />permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by<br />copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are<br />irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms<br />and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.<br />Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before<br />applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the<br />material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any<br />material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-<br />licensed material, or material used under an exception or<br />limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:<br />wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</p>
<p>Considerations for the public: By using one of our public<br />licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the<br />licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If<br />the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for<br />example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to<br />copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our<br />licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain<br />other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of<br />the licensed material may still be restricted for other<br />reasons, including because others have copyright or other<br />rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,<br />such as asking that all changes be marked or described.<br />Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to<br />respect those requests where reasonable.

<p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree<br />to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons<br />Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public<br />License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a<br />contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your<br />acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You<br />such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from<br />making the Licensed Material available under these terms and<br />conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 1 -- Definitions.</p>

<p>b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights<br />closely related to copyright including, without limitation,<br />performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database<br />Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or<br />categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights<br />specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar<br />Rights.</p>
<p>c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the<br />absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws<br />fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright<br />Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international<br />agreements.</p>
<p>d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or<br />any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights<br />that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.</p>
<p>e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,<br />or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public<br />License.</p>
<p>f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the<br />terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to<br />all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the<br />Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.</p>
<p>g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights<br />under this Public License.</p>
<p>h. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or<br />process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such<br />as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,<br />dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material<br />available to the public including in ways that members of the<br />public may access the material from a place and at a time<br />individually chosen by them.</p>
<p>i. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright<br />resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of<br />the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,<br />as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially<br />equivalent rights anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>j. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights<br />under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 2 -- Scope.</p>
<p>a. License grant.</p>
<p>1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br />the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br />non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br />exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</p>
<p>a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br />in part; and</p>
<p>b. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.</p>
<p>2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where<br />Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public<br />License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with<br />its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section<br />6(a).</p>
<p>4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The<br />Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in<br />all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,<br />and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The<br />Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or<br />authority to forbid You from making technical modifications<br />necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including<br />technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective<br />Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,<br />simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br />(4) never produces Adapted Material.</p>
<p>5. Downstream recipients.</p>
<p>a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every<br />recipient of the Licensed Material automatically<br />receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the<br />Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this<br />Public License.</p>
<p>b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br />any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br />apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br />Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br />Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br />Material.</p>
<p>6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br />may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br />are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br />with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br />the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br />provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</p>
<p>b. Other rights.</p>
<p>1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br />licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br />privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br />the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br />assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br />extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br />Rights, but not otherwise.</p>
<p>2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br />Public License.</p>
<p>3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br />collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br />Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br />under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br />licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br />reserves any right to collect such royalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 3 -- License Conditions.</p>
<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br />following conditions.</p>

<p>a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor<br />with the Licensed Material:</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under<br />this Public License to Share Adapted Material.</p>
<p>2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br />reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br />which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br />reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br />hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br />information.</p>
<p>3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br />information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br />reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>
<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br />apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
<p>a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br />to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br />portion of the contents of the database, provided You do not Share<br />Adapted Material;<br />b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br />contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br />Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br />Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br />c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br />all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br />replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br />Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br />EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br />AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br />ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br />IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br />WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br />PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br />ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br />KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br />ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br />TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br />NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br />INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br />COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br />USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br />ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br />DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br />IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br />above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br />possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br />waiver of all liability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</p>
<p>a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br />Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br />this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br />terminate automatically.</p>
<p>b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br />Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
<p>1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br />it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br />violation; or</p>
<p>2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br />right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br />of this Public License.</p>
<p>c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br />Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br />distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br />will not terminate this Public License.</p>
<p>d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br />License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br />terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p>
<p>b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br />Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br />independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 8 -- Interpretation.</p>
<p>a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br />shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br />conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br />be made without permission under this Public License.</p>
<p>b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br />deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br />minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br />cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br />without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br />conditions.</p>
<p>c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br />failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br />Licensor.</p>
<p>d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br />as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br />that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br />processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p>
