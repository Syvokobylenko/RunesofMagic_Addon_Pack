This should help to build the addon-img-databases if you don't know how me (Tinsus) did it.

This is a long file, but you will need about 7 minutes to do all this easy steps (if you know how)

00.00) Download FDB_Extraktor2 ( https://bitbucket.org/TellTod/fdb_extractor2/downloads )
00.25) If you can't start the FDB_Extrator2 install this ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679 )
00.50) Install LibreOffice/Apache OpenOffice/Microsoft Office or any Office Suit with a Spreadsheet-tool
00.75) Install a good lua-editor like Notepad++ (or an other tool with extended Search&Replace-Feature)

01) Start FDB_Extraktor2
02) Open the file data.fdb found in the fdb-dictionary of your Runes of Magic installation (use an actual client!)

03) Extract at leased the following files (or any file containing the information from guid -> imgid)

- addpowerobject.db
- armorobject.db
- imageobject.db
- itemobject.db
- mineobject.db
- runeobject.db
- weaponobject.db
- + forgotten files (the addon shows a test-icon. Find out the items-type and the corresponding db-filedb-file to extract—if a db-update doesn’t help)

you don't need the files, it's content is saved in the addon-code (only one image per type):
- cardobject.db
- recipeobject.db

04) create a new, empty-speadsheet file e.g. on your desktop
05) open all files under 3. without imageobject.db with the Spreadsheet-tool
06) Copy the first 6 columns (guid to imageid) of every file to your new file. You will get a very large sheet.

07) When this is done delete unnecessary columns so that you only keep the guid- and the imageid-columns. Also delete the headline-rows containing "guid" and "imageid"

08) not necessary: If you use Microsoft Excel you can sort the sheet based on the imageid. Sort it based on the imageid and delete all rows with only a "0". Then you can sort the sheet based on the guid (looks cleaner)

09) save the file as CSV-file

10) open the CSV-file with Notepad++ or the tool you want to use.

11) open the search&replace mask and set it to advanced to find \n and so one

12) replace '\n' with ',\n[' - add a '[' to the first line and remove the last '[' once
13) replace ';' with '] = '
13.5) if there is the comma in it's own row replace '\r' with ''

14) mark everything in the file and copy it to your clipboard using STRG+A, STRG+C
15) open the file itemID_imgID.lua in the LootIt/databases-folder
16) delete its content
17) type:

return {

18) paste the content of your clipboard, check if it is complete (its quite much and some PCs cap the contend based on the number of letters)
19) type:

}

20) save the file and close all open windows of Excel/Notepad, delete the temporary files from your desktop

21) repeat step 04
22) open imageobject.db
23) copy "guid" till "actfield"-columns and delete the unnecessary columns.
24) delete the rows containing nothing at actfield
25) repeat steps 09, 10, 11

26) replace '\n' with '",\n[' - add a '[' to the first line and remove the last '[' once
26.5) if there is the comma in it's own row replace '\r' with ''
27) replace ';' with '] = "'
27.5) replace all '\' with '/'
28) replace 'interface/icons/' with '', replace '.dds' with ''

29) repeat step 14
30) open the file imgID_file.lua in the LootIt/database-folder
31) repeat steps 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

32) now its done. You updated the LootIt-image-databases.


Please send the files to the author of LootIt to include it to the official addon. On that way everyone have the actual database and all images.
