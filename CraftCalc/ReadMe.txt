CraftCalc by The Gooch

Want to know how much percentage your crafting skill just raised as you gathered that herb, piece of wood, or metal?  How about while crafting items?  Want to know which items give you a higher percentage increase on your skills?

Well, you could already do that if you had your crafting skill window open and looked at the percentage before and after, then did the math yourself.  But, if you want some of that math done for you, this AddOn is for you.

Disclaimer:  I don't plan to do any more work on this AddOn.  I'm releasing it only because people noticed it in screenshots of other AddOns that myself or my Wife wrote.  I don't think it's that great of an AddOn (yet) but someone could use it to build upon.


Changes:
--------
v0.2:
- Modified to work with 1812 patch and unleashed to the public.

v0.1:
- Original working AddOn that my wife & I used.
