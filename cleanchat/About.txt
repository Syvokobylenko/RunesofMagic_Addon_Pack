== Description ==

CleanChat is a tool to simplify customizing the chat and to get rid of annoying messages.

=== Messages filtering ===
Messages filtering module allows to use predefined text grouped with categories and define own phrases to filter.

==== Predefined filters ====
Predefined filters are great way to get rid of most system and say messages, like Festival Events, Event Instances and anything you may find annoying.

Second advantage is that when text is changed (for example, you use Polish language client and RoM's translator corrected a typo) you don't have to do anything! Predefined filters are obtained in live time from your game client!

Predefined filters database is still completing. If you found a set of annoying messages, please comment on project or [[https://rom.curseforge.com/home/private-messages/|write a PM]]. Thanks a lot!

==== Custom filters ====
You have possibility to add custom filtering rules, like "You have opened auction interface" or gold sellers with certain keyword.
How? You can replace any part of phrase with * (asterisk) symbol. Like "You have * interface", "* auction interface" or "* opened *". It can't be easier!

For every custom filtering rule you have to choose one of available channels, like Yell, Say, System or currently joined Custom Channel.
