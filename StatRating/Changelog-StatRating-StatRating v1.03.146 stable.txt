My apologize I had some mis-information in regards to Dex no longer adding anything to pattk and therefore updated StatsDB.lua, I have reverted the changes.

Also, i has having some trouble with TortoiseSVN those issues have been resolved and I am now able to use the SVN repository to version control, this should make everything run much more smoothly.
