Implemented Follow-Up Quests: Information about a quest now include the quests following the currently shown quest in the quest line.
Implemented searching for loose ends: If a quest is not yet started you can search for where to pick up the quest line to accept that specific quest eventually.
Improved user experience/readability:
- Clicking the checkboxes for normal, daily, public and same zone quests searches immediately.
- Created placeholder for the search edit box. You can insert the quest's name or its ID. (Functionality to search for the ID already existed but its existence was not made clear.)
- Quest tree is always open when a quest is selected.
- Navigating the tree updates the info panel automatically.
- Inserted labels ("Follow-up Quests", "Requirements") into the quest tree to make clear of what kind a quest is.
- Flag frames in the tree have gray background and colored text in contrast to quests having colored frames and white text.
- Previously visited quests are colored gray.
- Added quest id to quest info panel.
- The level in the info panel is colored red if the level requirement is not met.
- (small other UI improvements)
